# Flask QR Code Generator
This program generates a QR code from a URL passed as a request parameter. The generated QR code image can then be downloaded as a PNG file.

## Requirements
- [Flask]('https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/')
- [qrcode]('https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/')

## Installation
- pip install flask
- pip install qrcode

## Usage
The program can be started on a web server. A QR code can be generated by making a GET request to the URL /qr, passing the URL address as a url request parameter.

For example: http://localhost:5000/qr?url=https://www.example.com

The program is started in debug mode, so error messages are displayed. In a production environment, this mode should be disabled.
